# Span-of-Control
Visualization of the span of control in a fake organization

A while back, I had to analyze the span of control in over 30 organizational units.  The end result was to recommend an approach for conducting performance evaluations.  By understanding how many direct reports were under any given supervisor and the variation of this statistic between units, leadership could anticipate challenges to each approach and make an informed decision.  

I decided to revisit this visualization because I wanted to infuse it with some lessons that I have learned since it was first made.  

## Lesson 1: Theory of Graphics
A copy of Edward Tufte's A Visual Display of Quantitative Information was gifted to me recently and it has given me a lot to think about.  Although many  principles he recommended have found their way into my own style, most likely through his wide influence on data visualization, I wanted to step through each chapter in hopes of reaching a deeper understanding of why he fought so hard to defend his style.  

As a result, my perspective on data graphics and design has shifted.  The most influential advice in the text was to think about the data per square inch, which forced me to think about the total number of data points represented in the graphic.  The power of a graph is its ability to convey voluminous and/or complex patterns.  Graphics should be reserved for large sets of data while a set of few numbers (or even a single number) should be displayed inline or in a table.  By elevating graphics as a reserved task, more effort and care should be given to its creation. 

## Lesson 2: Accessibility
